# The Alchemist 
*Don't practice alchemy without a friend!*

# The Goal
This is an app designed to replace PsychonautWiki's Journal after the creator traded its community for a quick buck. If you found yourself lost and confused what to do when PsychonuatWiki Journal started demanding payment for its servecies, **Alchemist** is for you. 

Harm Reduction is not a joke, and access to high quality and clean data can go a long way. 

That is why **Alchemist belives high quality information and useful tools should be free**, especially when the health and saftey of others is on the line. And as such, **Alchemist will be free**. ***Forever***

# The Design
Alchemist not only aims to replace PsychonautWiki's offering completely, but surpass it. 

Have an extensive amount of data from PsychonautWiki journal? Import it directly into Alchemist!

All of the features you know and love will be present, plus a little more. Data is sourced from both PsychonautWiki *and* Tripsit.me, enabling a huge offering of substances that were not in PsychonautWiki Journal (updated every release).

Alchemist currently has implemented: 
* Substance Statistics
   * Top Substances
   * Total Uses
   * Total Mass Consumed over Lifetime
* Journal Entries
   * Duration Graphs
   * Interaction Checking
   * Multiple Doses/Experience
* Substance Information
* Searching for Journals/Substance Information
* Custom substance colors
* QuickAdd of substances

The beta release will aim to be fully feature complete when compared to PsychonautWiki Journal, and this is when the app is considered ready to launch on app stores. 

The full release will have:
* Sharing with freinds (via private servers)
* Harm Reduction tools & calculators
* User Suggested Features!

# The People
This project was made almost entirely by [https://github.com/Zemchar/](Juniper Mixon), with setup help from the SubstanceSync team. The project was archived, so this project is now considered independent.

# The Cost
*** Alchemist will be Free. Forever*** 

However, it is not free to publish apps and keep them maintained. If you like what I do and wish to keep this project going, please consider donating.
